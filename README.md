# 🧠 Unity Maze Solver with Dijkstra's Algorithm

This is a simple but visually engaging **maze-solving visualization** project built in **Unity**, designed to demonstrate how **Dijkstra’s algorithm** works in a grid-based maze environment.

The maze is procedurally generated at runtime, and the shortest path from the start to the goal is animated step-by-step to show how the algorithm progresses.

## 🎯 Why I Made This

I created this project as a way to **learn and better understand Dijkstra's algorithm** through an interactive and visual medium. Rather than studying the algorithm abstractly, I wanted to **build something fun and hands-on** — and this project helped me reinforce key pathfinding concepts in a meaningful way.
